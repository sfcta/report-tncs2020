Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft
began providing on-demand, app-based transportation ride-hail
services in California in 2009. In 2012, the California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) began formally regulating TNCs in the state. The
CPUC develops regulations through public rulemaking proceedings,
and implements regulations through its Consumer Protection and
Enforcement Division (CPED).

Since 2014, TNCs operating in California have
been required to submit annual reports to
the CPUC. These TNC Annual Reports contain
information about a wide range of topics,
including, but not limited to, trip requests and
completions, collisions and incidents, assaults
and harassment, and miles and hours driven.

This information is of great interest to cities
like San Francisco where TNCs operate. While
TNCs can argue for confidential treatment of
specific data required to be submitted in their
Annual Reports, the CPUC has designated
the TNC Annual Reports from 2020 onward as
presumptively public, and a proposed decision
would make all past reports public.

In February 2022, the San Francisco County
Transportation Authority (”Transportation Authority”)
requested the 2020 public TNC Annual Reports
for Uber and Lyft from the CPUC.[^1] The CPUC
treated the request as a Public Records Act
(PRA) request, and provided the reports later
that month. These reports cover the period
from September 2019 to August 2020 and are
highly redacted. Subsequently, in October 2022,
the CPUC published substantially redacted
versions of the 2021 public TNC Annual
Reports.[^2] Of these reports, only Uber’s 2020 public TNC Annual Reports satisfy the
CPUC’s reporting requirements, while the others were redacted to remove public
data. When the CPUC releases the 2021 public TNC Annual Reports consistent with its
confidentiality determinations, the Transportation Authority will produce a follow-up
report documenting findings.

[^1]: As detailed below in Chapter 1, Section V, the CPUC has granted confidential treatment over limited data required to be
submitted in the TNC’s Annual Reports. Use of the term “public TNC Annual Report” is meant to refer to the portions of the
full TNC Annual Reports that the CPUC has deemed to be public and not subject to confidentiality redactions.

The CPUC also regulates the nascent autonomous vehicle (AV) passenger service
industry. The CPUC develops AV regulations in the very same proceedings as TNC
regulations, and likewise implements them through the CPeD. AV passenger services
are like TNCs in more ways than not, but with the important distinction that they plan
to, and in some cases already do, use self-driving cars without any human safety
driver. AV passenger service companies submit quarterly reports which, by contrast,
are routinely published by the CPUC, but similar to the public TNC Annual Reports,
are heavily redacted.

The purpose of this document is to provide information on TNC activity in
San Francisco and throughout California as summarized from the CPUC’s 2020 public
TNC Annual Reports. The report is intended to inform the Transportation Authority
Board, as well as state and local policy-makers in other arenas, and the general
public, on general characteristics of the TNC market (how many, when, and where
are trips happening?), and on performance of TNCs in terms of public safety, labor,
environment, and accessibility.

This document examines the 2020 public TNC Annual Reports to present findings
organized into topic areas:

- Reporting Compliance and Integrity
- General Characteristics
- Public Safety
- Labor
- Environment
- Accessibility

Each section describes the public interest in TNC activities in that area, the CPUC’s role
in providing oversight, and what the 2020 public TNC Annual Reports tell us about
TNCs. Note that Lyft’s 2020 public Annual Reports are substantially incomplete, which is
discussed in detail in Section 2.

> In 2019, San Francisco voters approved Proposition D, which imposes a tax

> to be collected in 2020. The Prop D revenue trends have been highly variable

> revenues, including by analyzing the CPUC’s public TNC Annual Reports.

## What are TNCs?
TNCs are companies that provide on-demand passenger service through a web-enabled
platform. Uber and Lyft are the most well-known TNCs and collectively provide almost
all TNC service in California. These services provide taxi-like point-to-point transportation,
which is primarily provided in TNC drivers’ personal vehicles. TNCs rapidly grew into a
popular transportation option likely due to the conveniences that TNCs initially provided
including point-to-point service, ease of booking and paying for rides, shorter wait
times, generally lower fares (relative to taxis), and real-time communication with drivers.
However, due to their widespread adoption in urban areas, TNCs have been shown
to increase congestion and emissions by shifting trips from walking, biking, and transit
to private vehicles, by adding zero-occupancy “deadheading” mileage in between
passenger trips, and by blocking travel lanes for pickups and drop-offs.[^3] They have also
been shown to decrease transit ridership in these areas.[^4]

## Who regulates TNCs in California?
In California, TNCs are generally regulated by the CPUC, pursuant to the [Passenger
Charter-party Carriers’ Act, PU Code § 5351](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PUC&division=2.&title=&part=&chapter=8.&article=1.). TNCs operate under different regulatory
constraints, oversight, and enforcement than taxis, which are regulated at the local level
and are often subject to limits on fleet size and pricing, safety requirements, and are
required to serve all types of passengers. TNCs are required to comply with insurance
requirements, regulations on the transportation of minors, and to conduct criminal
background checks on drivers. TNCs are required to have a driver training program,
an accessibility plan, a zero-tolerance policy, and a plan for avoiding a divide between
able and disabled communities. TNCs are required to submit annual reports to the
CPUC, and the CPUC may require additional reports or plans to be filed at its discretion.
Reporting requirements are discussed in detail in the following section.

## What are the 2020 TNC reporting requirements?
The 2020 TNC Annual Reports are a collection of individual reports submitted to the
CPUC by each TNC operating in California. The 2020 public TNC Annual Reports are
the portions of the full 2020 TNC Annual Reports that the CPUC designates public.
Table 1 lists the required 2020 TNC Annual Reports and identifies whether they are
confidential, public, or partly public. There are 20 individual reports, of which the CPUC
has designated 19 either completely or partially public (some items within the reports
are confidential and may be redacted). Two reports include “Confidential” in their name
for legacy reasons but are, in fact, public. The document _Driver Names & IDs_ is the sole
report designated entirely confidential as it contains personal information of drivers.

## How did the CPUC arrive at these reporting requirements?
The CPUC develops TNC regulations through a quasi-legislative public rulemaking
proceeding. The CPUC’s Rulemaking R12-12-011 is the primary TNC proceeding and
is charged with developing regulations in the areas of safety, ride sharing between
multiple passengers, transportation access (including access to public highways and
to transportation services using public highways), and insurance.[^5] Major decisions
related to data reporting, confidential treatment of data, and public sharing of data are
summarized in [Appendix A](../xa_cpuc_decisions/). Annual reporting requirements were first established by
Decision 13-09-045 (D. 13-09-045) in 2013, which include:

- Detailed trip data
- Public safety incidents
- Driver mileage
- Driver hours

[^5]: Order Instituting Rulemaking on Regulations Relating to Passenger Carriers, Ridesharing, and New Online-Enabled
Transportation Services, R.12-12-011, issued December 27, 2012. https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M040/K862/40862944.PDF

D. 13-09-045 also required TNCs to submit plans to ensure accessible TNC service to
disabled communities.
Decision 16-04-041, issued in 2016, expanded the annual data reporting to include:

- a report on vehicles that were driven over 50,000 miles in a year
- a report on incidents arising from fare-splitting (or “pooling”)[^6] services
- a report on how fare-splitting operations have impacted the environment
- a report on the effect of fare-splitting operations on traffic-related injuries
- a report documenting drivers suspended for public safety reasons,
including violation of zero-tolerance policy, assaulting a passenger or
member of the public, harassing a passenger or member of the public,
or soliciting business without the TNC app platform

[^6]: “Fare-slitting” and “pooling” are synonyms which refer to passengers that agree to share all or part of their trip with
another paying customer who has also agreed to the same, regardless of whether the separate paying passengers are
ultimately matched together resulting in a shared ride.

The 2016 decision also imposed several one-time reporting requirements that TNCs
must submit:

- waybills to document the calculation of fares for fare-splitting services
- a plan for studying the impacts of fare-splitting services on traffic safety
- a plan for studying the impacts of fare-splitting services on the environment
- a plan for studying the impacts of TNC vehicles on traffic congestion and VMT

<!--
- established annual data reporting requirements, including:
  - For each completed trip:
    - zip codes of origin, pickup, and drop-off
    - date and time of origin, pickup, and drop-off 
    - amount paid
  - For unfulfilled trip requests:
    - zip-code of trip request
    - date and time of trip request
    - reason why the request was not fulfilled
  - Citations by law enforcement 
  - DUI complaints 
  - Assault and harassment complaints
  - Average daily driver hours  
  - Average daily driver miles
- required TNCs to submit plans to ensure accessible TNC service to disabled communities.  

D. 16-04-041
- added new annual reporting requirements:
  - report vehicles that have driven over 50,000 miles in a year
  - driver suspensions related to public safety issues, including driving under the influence (DUI), assaulting a passenger or member of the public; threatening or harassing a member of the public; or soliciting business separate from the TNC app; 
  - incidents arising from fare-splitting operations; 
  - how fare-splitting operations have impacted the environment.  
- imposed one-time requirements that TNCs must:
  - submit waybills to document the calculation of fares for fare-splitting services;
  - submit a plan for studying the impacts of fare-splitting services on traffic safety; 
  - a plan for studying the impacts of fare-splitting service on the environment; 
  - a plan for studying the impacts of TNC vehicles on traffic congestion and vehicle-miles traveled (VMT);

The CPUC has not shared the annual reports required by D. 13-09-045 and D. 16-04-
041 publicly to date, with the exception of the incomplete and heavily redacted 2020
public TNC Annual Reports released to the Transportation Authority in response to our
request, and the even further redacted 2021 public TNC Annual Reports. The record
indicates Uber submitted documentation of their fare-splitting calculations, but not any
other one-time requirements, pursuant to D. 16-04-041. The record does not indicate
that other companies submitted any of the D. 16-04-041 one-time requirements.

While the rulemaking track identifies the categories of data required of TNC Annual
Reports, CPUC CPeD staff develop report templates and reporting guidance. CPeD staff
have revised report templates and guidance over time both with and without general
public noticing.

## How did the CPUC determine what is confidential vs public data?
The CPUC rulemaking R12-12-011 also establishes what data is confidential and what
data is public. [D. 13-09-045](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M077/K192/77192335.PDF) established a presumption of confidentiality, which was
reversed by [D. 20-03-014](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M329/K477/329477640.PDF). Reports filed before 2020 were presumed confidential,
while reports filed in 2020 and after are presumed public. Under D. 20-03-014, a TNC
must request confidential treatment of certain data items in their annual reports, and
substantiate their requests with "granular specificity".

Both Uber and Lyft submitted motions with sweeping requests for confidential
treatment of their 2020 TNC Annual Reports. The CPUC’s Administrative Law Judge
has ruled in favor of public disclosure of the reports, while respecting the need to
prevent the disclosure of potentially personally identifiable information.[^7][^8] The 2020
Confidentiality Ruling granted confidential treatment to data items relating to driver
information, precise latitude and longitude, certain information about assaults and
harassments, and information that is sealed under a court order or protected through
a confidentiality agreement, but rejected confidential treatment of the majority of data
items, finding no merit in the claims of disclosure of personal information or of trade
secrets.[^9] The Commission also found “significant difficulties and delays in obtaining
TNCs’ annual report data based upon broad-brush-style or rushed confidentiality
claims,” and that “TNCs’ failures to timely comply with the annual reporting
requirements have delayed the expeditious review of TNC data and the production of
nonconfidential data to the public.”[^10]

The CPUC has twice upheld its 2020 Confidentiality Ruling directing the public
release of the 2020 public TNC Annual Reports in response to repeated appeals by
Lyft.[^11][^12] However, the CPUC has yet to release any TNC Public Annual Reports that fully
comply with the Administrative Law Judge’s confidentiality rulings (i.e. reports which
fully provide the data categories deemed public by the Commission and which only
redact categories of data deemed confidential). The Commission’s latest decision
denying Lyft’s appeal of the 2020 Confidentiality Ruling directed Lyft to submit to
the CPUC a full public version of their 2020 Annual Report before the end of March
2023. The Transportation Authority has not yet received the re-submitted version of
the Lyft’s 2020 Public TNC Annual Report. It’s possible that data missing or redacted
from Lyft’s 2020 Public TNC Report was removed pending final dispensation of Lyft’s
confidentiality challenges.
