The 2020 Annual Reports collected from Uber and Lyft by the CPUC reveal regulatory failure on part of the CPUC and compliance failure on part of Uber and Lyft.  It also reveals the near-exclusive concentration of TNC activity in urban areas and potentially profound issues of public safety, labor, environment, and accessibility.  
-	The CPUC has failed to develop and enforce coherent and useful data reporting requirements.  As a consequence, the impacts of TNCs on public safety, congestion, the environment, and equity have been largely unexamined.
-	Uber and Lyft report inconsistent and self-evidently erroneous data.
-	TNCs operate almost exclusively in urban areas.  Yet the cities in which they operate have virtually no regulatory authority to manage the impacts of TNCs.  
    - San Francisco has by far the greatest concentration of TNCs, with nearly 500 times more TNCs per square mile than the rest of the state.
-	TNCs served between 218 million and 277 million trips
    - Due to Lyft’s failure to report data, total TNC trips by day of week are not known.  Uber’s data reveals TNC trips take place on all days of the week and at all times of day but usage shows relatively traditional AM and PM peaks, and a trend towards increased usage as the work week progresses.
