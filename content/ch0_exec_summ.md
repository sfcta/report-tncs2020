Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft began providing on-demand, app-based transportation services in California in 2009.  In 2012, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) began formally regulating TNCs in the state, and since 2014, TNCs operating in California have been required to submit annual reports to the CPUC.  These TNC Annual Reports contain information about a wide range of topics, including but not limited to trip requests and completions, accidents and incidents, assaults and harassment, and miles and hours driven.  The CPUC has designated the TNC Annual Reports from 2020 onward as public, and a proposed decision would make all past reports public.  In February 2022, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) requested the 2020 Public TNC Annual Reports for Uber and Lyft from the CPUC.  The CPUC treated the request as a Public Records Act (PRA) request, and provided the reports later that month.  These reports cover the period from September 2019 to August 2020.  Subsequently, in October 2022, the CPUC published substantially redacted versions of the 2021 Public TNC Annual Reports.[^1]  Of these reports, only Uber’s 2020 Public TNC Annual Reports satisfy the CPUC’s confidentiality requirements.  The information in the TNC Annual Reports is critical to helping the public and decision-makers understand how many TNC trips occur in San Francisco and California, how much vehicle travel they generate, and their potential effects on congestion, transit ridership, and their safety.

The CPUC also regulates the nascent autonomous vehicle (AV) passenger service industry.  The CPUC develops AV regulations in the proceedings and enforces them through the same staff divisions as TNC regulations.  AV passenger services are like TNCs in more ways than not, but with the important distinction that they plan to, and in some cases already do, use self-driving cars without any human safety driver.  The capabilities of self-driving cars are not well understood.  If not effectively regulated, AV passenger service may not only exacerbate issues faced by cities with TNCs, but also pose serious new public safety risks.    AV passenger service companies submit quarterly reports which, in contrast to the Public TNC Annual Reports, are routinely published by the CPUC, but which are also heavily redacted.

The purpose of TNCs 2020 is to provide information on TNC activity in San Francisco and throughout California. The report is intended to inform the Transportation Authority board which is comprised of the members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, as well as state and local policy-makers in other arenas, and the general public, on general characteristics of the TNC market (how many, when, and where are trips happening?), public safety, labor, environment, and accessibility.  An additional purpose is to summarize AV passenger service quarterly reports and to illustrate the limited insights into current AV operations available to the public and decision-makers, due to the withholding and redaction of public records addressing this emerging transportation technology.

The Executive Summary highlights key findings from the TNCs 2020 analysis of the TNC Public Annual Reports.  These findings are categorized by:
-	Compliance and integrity
-	General characteristics
-	Public safety
-	Labor
-	Environment
-	Accessibility
-   Key findings from The 2021 TNC Public Annual Reports

Evaluations of the 2021 Public Annual Reports and the 2022 AV Public Quarterly Reports are provided in Appendices C and D.

## 1. Reporting Compliance and Integrity
Data compliance and integrity is a prerequisite for effective analysis to guide the development of public policy and enforce regulations. Analysis of the 2020 Public Annual Reports finds that: 

###  1.1  |  THE PUBLIC ANNUAL REPORTS ARE INCOMPLETE BY THE STANDARDS SET BY THE CPUC

The 2020 Confidentiality Ruling established which records are public and which are confidential.  Table 4 lists the individual reports that make up the 2020 Annual Reports and measures their completeness as the share of required public fields are present and unredacted. Uber’s 2020 Public Annual Reports are complete, with the exception of one missing field in the Accidents & Incidents report.  Many of Lyft’s 2020 Annual Reports are not complete.

{{< /conditional_format_table_by_condition >}}

### 1.2  |  Uber's and Lyft's Data is Internally Inconsistent

Internal consistency means that the data in one part of a company’s Annual Reports does not contradict data in another part.  In the simplest terms, the total number of trips in one report should match the total number of trips in another.  Contradictory or internally inconsistent data prevents effective informed policy-making and effective regulatory oversight.  Table 1 summarizes the internal consistency of 6 metrics that can be independently derived from different reports with the Annual Reports.  Both Uber and Lyft’s reports have internal inconsistencies.  Lyft’s reports are incomplete, preventing full analysis of their consistency.  

<figcaption>Table 2: Summary of Internal Consistency of the 2020 Public TNC Annual Reports</figcaption>

{{< /conditional_format_table >}}

### 1.3  |  Many of the inconsistencies in Lyft's reports are much greater than Uber's

A basic statistic describing TNC activity is the number of completed trips. Table 2 and Table 3 show the number of completed trips reported by Uber and Lyft in each report.  Uber’s reported completed trips are internally inconsistent, differing by 9.3 million, or 6%.  Lyft’s reported completed trips are internally inconsistent, differing by 49.7 million, or 81%.  In this case, Lyft’s internal inconsistencies are 14 times greater than Uber’s internal inconsistencies.  

<figcaption>Table 3: Uber Completed Trips by Report</figcaption>

| Source | Trip Requests | Difference | Percent Difference |
| :---   |    :---:      |   :---:    |      :---:         |
| Disaggregate trip list <br/><font size=-0.5>(from _Requests Accepted_)</font> | 157,167,691 | - | - |
| Aggregated by zip code <br/><font size=-0.5>(from _Aggregated Requests Accepted_)</font> | 166,464,298 | 9,296,607 | 6% |

<figcaption>Table 4: Lyft Completed Trips by Report</figcaption>

| Source | Trip Requests | Difference | Percent Difference |
| :---   |    :---:      |   :---:    |      :---:         |
| Disaggregate trip list <br/><font size=-0.5>(from _Requests Accepted_)</font> | 61,072,046 | - | -
| Aggregated by zip code <br/><font size=-0.5>(from _Aggregated Requests Accepted_)</font> | 110,786,422 | 49,714,376 | 81%

The extent and scale of these inconsistencies prevent development of informed policy-making and regulatory oversight of TNCs.  For example, whether Lyft completed 61 million trips or 110 million trips is critical to understanding the overall TNC market size.

### 1.4  |  Lyft's trip acceptance rates are self-evidently false

Requests for TNC trips may not result in completed trips for a number of reasons. For example, a request may be accepted by a driver and then cancelled, or a passenger may cancel their request after some time has passed. The trip acceptance rate (of all trip requests) may reveal implicit or explicit biases if, for example, drivers are less likely to accept trip requests from some areas compared to others.  However, extensive errors in Lyft’s aggregated request data made it impossible to perform meaningful analysis of trip acceptance rates.  

Figure 1 shows the areas where each company’s trip completion rate was 100%.  Uber has perfect trip completion rates in only a handful of zip codes  , and all these received fewer than 400 trip requests.  Lyft reports perfect trip completion rates in half of the zip codes where it provided trips  , including all of Sacramento County, and most of San Diego and Santa Clara counties.  This implies, for example, that of the 4.2 million trip requests received in Sacramento County alone, not a single one was ever cancelled by a passenger or not accepted by a driver.  Lyft received more than 26 million trip requests across in these zip codes.  Lyft’s trip completion rates are self-evidently false.

</div>

### 1.5  |  Many reporting requirements are not clearly defined

The CPUC provides templates for each annual report.  For categorical or descriptive data, CPUC provides examples but does not articulate a required taxonomy.  This leads to inconsistencies as in, for example, the collision type categories shown in Table 5.  Uber and Lyft report collision information using different numbers and types of categories which they defined themselves.  For example, Uber used 7 categories and Lyft used 5 categories.  Uber described the parties or objects involved in the collision, and Lyft described the level of damage to the vehicle.  In the absence of clear requirements from the CPUC, Uber and Lyft decided independently how to report these data.  Consequently, they report the types of collisions, DUI complaints, law enforcement citations, accessibility complaints differently, preventing effective regulatory oversight.

## 2. General Characteristics

The previous section evaluated the completeness and integrity of the 2020 Public Annual Reports, revealing extensive data quality issues.  This section explores the reports more thoroughly, to identify general characteristics of TNC activity, where possible, and acknowledge limitations and uncertainty.  Analysis of the 2020 Public Annual Reports finds:

### 2.1  |  Nearly two-thirds of TNC trips are in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego Counties

Figure 2 shows the density of TNC trips by zip code.  It shows that TNC trips are highly concentrated in a few urban areas.   Trips in Los Angeles County, San Francisco County, and San Diego count made up nearly two-thirds of all TNC trips in California.  San Francisco has the greatest concentration of trips, which are further concentrated within the downtown core that makes up roughly a quarter of the city’s land area.

</div> 
<figcaption>Figure 2: TNC Trips per Square Mile in California</figcaption><br/>

### 2.2  |  San Francisco has 500 times more TNCs per square mile than in the rest of California

Figure 3 shows the total number of trips and trips per square mile for the 10 counties with the most TNC trips.  San Francisco had nearly 500 times more TNCs per square mile than the rest of the state, and more than 40 times more TNCs per square mile than Los Angeles County, the next most dense TNC market in California.

<figcaption>Figure 3: Trips and Trip Density by County for the Top 10 Counties by TNC Trips</figcaption><br/>

### 2.3  |  The vast majority (93%) of TNC trips are not "pooled"

A   "pooled" TNC trip is a trip where a passenger indicates they are willing to share a ride with another passenger in exchange for a reduced cost.  A pooled trip is "matched" when two or more passenger requests are put into a single driver itinerary that results in the passengers sharing some portion of their trip.
Figure 4 compares successfully matched and completed pooled trips to trips that were requested pooled, but not matched, and to completed non-pooled trips.  Nearly all (93%) of TNC trips were single-party trips that were not pooled  . A larger share of Lyft’s trips were requested as pooled trips, but a smaller share were successfully completed, compared to Uber.

<figcaption>Figure 4: Pooling of Completed Trips</figcaption>

## 3. Public Safety

The Passenger Charter-party Carriers’ Act, enacted in 1961, requires the CPUC to regulate “[t]he use of public highways for the transportation of passengers for compensation … and to promote carrier and public safety through its safety enforcement regulations.”[^2]  The CPUC requires TNCs submit 4 reports documenting specific events relevant to passenger and public safety.  Analysis of these reports finds:

[^2]: [California Public Utilities Code § 5352(a)](  https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PUC&division=2.&title=&part=&chapter=8.&article=1)

### 3.1  |  Lyft reports 3 times more public safety incidents per trip than Uber, and 30 times more assaults and harassments per trip

Uber and Lyft collectively reported 75,000 public safety incidents.  As shown in Figure 5,  Lyft’s reported public safety incident rate (per 100,000 trips) is 3 times Uber’s, and Lyft’s reported assault and harassment rate is 30 times Uber’s.  This suggests either that serious differences in public safety risks between Uber and Lyft exist, or that the companies are reporting data inconsistently with each other.

{{% plotly_bar id="Fig5" csvfile="content/ch4_public_safety/public_safety_incidents_rate.csv" title="Public Safety Issues per 100,000 Trips" height="full" width="full" style="colorblind" bmode="stack" %}}
<figcaption>Figure 5: Public Safety Incidents per 100,000 trips</figcaption><br/>

### 3.2  |  Lyft appears not to comply with driver suspension requirements for driving under the influence

The CPUC requires that “[p]romptly after a zero-tolerance   complaint is filed, the TNC shall suspend the driver for further investigation.”[^3]  Lyft does not appear to comply with this requirement.  Lyft classified 93% of driver consequences following DUI complaints as “driver provided with warning and/or education,” which suggests neither a temporary suspension nor a permanent deactivation.  The record does not indicate any actions taken by the CPUC against Lyft for failing to suspend drivers involved in DUI complaints.

<figcaption>Table 6: Driver Consequences of DUI Complaints</figcaption>

Metric | Uber | Lyft | Total
 ---- | ----: | ----: | ----:
Total Incidents | 7,358 | 7,745 | 15,103
Temporary Suspensions | 6,911 | 468 | 7,379
Permanent Deactivations | 447 | 37 | 484
Not temporarily suspended or permanently deactivated | 0 | 7,240 | 7,240
_Percent temporarily suspended_ | _94%_ | _6%_ | _49%_
_Percent permanently deactivated_ | _6%_ | _0%_ | _3%_
_Percent neither temporarily suspended nor deactivated_ | _0%_ | _93%_ | _48%_

### 3.3  |  Uber data suggests it has active drivers that should have been permanently suspended

Uber data shows that 1,250 (30%) of the 4,162 drivers classified as “permanently suspended” are also classified as “reactivated.”  It is unclear whether these drivers are permanently deactivated or not.  If they were reactivated, it is not clear why their permanent suspension was overturned, or the potential impacts to the safety of passengers and the general public. 

<figcaption>Table 7: Uber Driver Suspensions and Reactivations</figcaption>

Status | Not Reactivated | Reactivated | Total
---- | ----: | ----: | ----:
Not Permanently Suspended | 110 | 9,505 | 9,615
Permanently Suspended | 2,912 | 1,250 | 4,162
Total | 3,022 | 10,755 | 13,777


## 4. Labor

State law and CPUC regulations create requirements on driver working conditions to protect drivers and ensure public safety.  Analysis of the 2020 Public Annual Reports finds:

### 4.1  |  Uber and Lyft may violate legal drive-time limits

California law limits drivers providing passenger transportation to “10 hours in any 24-hour period unless 8 consecutive hours off duty have elapsed.”   Figure 3 shows the share of driver days by number of hours driven for each company.  It suggests that each company has drivers exceeding legal drive time limits.  Before Covid 8% of Uber’s driver days exceeded 10 hours and during Covid 6% exceeded 10 hours.  Before and during the Covid 4% of Lyft’s driver days exceeded 10 hours.  This report alone cannot confirm that a violation has occurred, but implies that it may have.  No known investigations have been conducted or enforcement actions have been taken to address the over 1.3 annual million possible violations of California labor laws.

<figcaption>Figure 6: Driver Days by Hours Worked</figcaption><br/>

## 5. Environment

The Clean Miles Standard and Incentives Program directed the CPUC to implement “annual targets and goals, beginning in 2023, for the reduction […] of emissions of greenhouse gases per passenger-mile driven on behalf of a transportation network company”.[^4]  Greenhouse gases are a key contributor to global climate change.  Analysis of the 2020 Public Annual Reports finds: 

[^4]: [Senate Bill No. 1014](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1014)

### 5.1  |  Lyft's incomplete reports prevent environmental oversight

Lyft’s annual report withholds key data items in the Requests Accepted report necessary to estimate emissions: vehicle miles traveled (VMT), geographic trip origin and destination data, and vehicle make, model, and year.

### 5.2  |  Uber produced an estimated 494,000 Metric Tons of CO2

The SFCTA estimates that Uber emitted 494,000 metric tons of CO2 from September 2019 to August 2020, about 30% of which was produced when the vehicle is not transporting a passenger.[^5]  Uber’s total CO2 emissions were similar to the CO2 emitted by the 2020 Caldwell Fire in northern California which burned 81,000 acres.[^6]  It would take approximately 22.7 million trees to absorb an annual amount of CO2 equal to that emitted by Uber in California.[^7]  Lyft did not report mileage, vehicle make, model, or year, so their emissions cannot be estimated.  

[^5]: Emissions were estimated individually for each trip, using the vehicle make, model, and year, mileage by period, and emissions rates from fueleconomy.gov
[^6]: [California Air Resources Board, Wildfire Emission Estimates for 2020.](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/Wildfire%20Emission%20Estimates%20for%202020%20_Final.pdf)
[^7]: According to the USDA, a single mature tree absorbs, on average, 48 lbs of CO2 annually.

<figcaption>Table 8: Estimated CO2 Emitted by Uber by Period</figcaption>

Metric | Period 1 <br/> _Waiting for ride request_ | Period 2 <br/> _On the way to pickup passenger_ | Period 3 <br/> _Transporting passenger_ | Total
 ---- | ----: | ----: | -----: | ----:
Total CO2 | 85,408 | 61,523 | 346,790 | 493,722
Share of CO2 | 17% | 12% | 70% | 100%

## 6. Accessibility

Supporting the access to on-demand transportation by people who use wheelchairs is a key responsibility of the CPUC’s regulation of TNCs.  The TNC Access for All Act  directs the CPUC to “establish a program relating to accessibility for persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users who need a wheelchair-accessible vehicle (WAV)”.[^8]  The Access for All Act establishes a fund that collects a fee on every TNC trip in the state that can be used to provide on-demand WAV service.  TNCs report accessibility data in their annual reports, and through “Advice Letters” filed quarterly through the Access for All program.  

[^8]: [California Senate Bill No. 1376](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB13766)

### 6.1  |  Less than half of all WAV trip requests are served

Uber and Lyft received a combined total of 230,000 requests for WAV trips and completed 108,000, of these requests, or 47%.  

<figcaption>Table 9: WAV Requests and Completed Trips</figcaption>

Metric | Uber | Lyft | Total
----- | ----: | ----: | ----:
WAV Requests | 217,935 | 11,605 | 229,540
Completed WAV Trips | 101,594 | 6,158 | 107,752
Completion Rate | 47% | 53% | 47%

### 6.2  |  Uber provides nearly all TNC WAV trips in California

Uber provided the vast majority of TNC WAV trips, about 102,000 out of 108,00 total, or 93%.  Lyft provided about 6,000 WAV trips, about 7% of the total.  

### 6.3  |  Lyft's accessibility reports conflict with Access for All data

Lyft’s WAV data contradicts their Access for All filings.  Under the Access for All program, TNCs may choose to file Advice Letters with the CPUC containing service data for counties and quarters where they are seeking offsets against monies remitted to the Access for All fund.  Because the Advice Letters are selectively filed, they represent a subset of all WAV trips. Lyft reports more WAV requests in their Advice Letters than they do in their annual reports, which describe all of Lyft’s California WAV requests.  

<figcaption>Table 10: Comparison of Lyft WAV Requests in the Annual Reports and Advice Letters</figcaption>

Quarter | Accessibility Report | Advice Letters | Share of Annual Report Totals Reported in Advice Letters
 ----- | ----: | ----: | ----:
2019 Q4 | 4,252 | 392 | 9%
2020 Q1 | 3,344 | 3,853 | 115%
2020 Q2 | 1,307 | 1,572 | 120%

## 7. The 2021 TNC Public Annual Reports and the 2022 AV Quarterly Reports

### 7.1  |  The 2021 Public Annual Reports are less complete than the 2020 Public Annual Reports

Uber’s 2021 Public Annual Reports are heavily redacted, mirroring the redactions and withholdings from Lyft’s 2020 and 2021 Public Annual Reports.  This is in contrast to Uber’s 2020 Public Annual Reports, which were substantially complete.  Lyft's 2021 Public Annual Reports contain redactions that are similar in scope to the data withheld from their 2020 Public Annual Reports.  Appendix C provides an evaluation of the 2021 Public Annual Reports.

### 7.2  |  Where consistency can be evaluated, the 2021 Public Annual Reports are more consistent than the 2020 Public Annual Reports

Because the 2021 Public Annual Reports are less complete, they cannot be evaluated as comprehensively for internal consistency.  Where internal consistency can be evaluated Uber and Lyft both made substantial improvements, however internal inconsistencies remain.

### 7.3  |  The 2022 AV Quarterly reports are heavily redacted, like the 2021 Public Annual Reports
Cruise and Waymo submit quarterly reports under their passenger service deployment permits with the CPUC.  Both companies' public quarterly reports are heavily redacted, similar to the 2021 Public Annual Reports.  

### 7.4  |  The 2022 AV Quarterly reports are internally inconsistent
Cruise's and Waymo's Public Quarterly Reports contain inconsistencies similar to those found in the 2020 TNC Public Annual Reports.
