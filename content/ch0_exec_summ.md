Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft began
providing on-demand, app-based transportation ride-hail services in
California in 2009, and have been required to submit annual reports
to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) since 2014. These
TNC Annual Reports contain information about a wide range of topics,
including, but not limited to, trip requests and completions, collisions,
and incidents, assaults and harassment, and miles and hours driven. The
CPUC has designated the TNC Annual Reports from 2020 onward as
public, and a proposed decision would make all past reports public. The
2020 reports are the first reports made public by the CPUC.

This information is of great interest to cities like San Francisco
where TNCs operate. In February 2022, the San Francisco County
Transportation Authority (Transportation Authority) requested the
2020 public TNC Annual Reports for Uber and Lyft from the CPUC,
which provided the reports later that month. These reports cover the
period from September 2019 to August 2020 and have been highly
redacted by the CPUC.

The CPUC also regulates the nascent autonomous vehicle (AV) passenger service
industry and is developing AV regulations in the very same proceedings as TNC
regulations. AV passenger services are like TNCs in many ways, but with the important
distinction that they plan to, and in some cases already do, use self-driving cars without
any human safety driver. AV passenger service companies submit quarterly reports
which, by contrast, are routinely published by the CPUC, but similar to the public TNC
Annual Reports, are heavily redacted.

This report analyzes and summarizes the 2020 public TNC Annual Reports, and is
intended to inform the Transportation Authority Board, as well as state and local
policy-makers, and the public, on general characteristics of the TNC market, and on the
performance of TNCs in terms of public safety, labor, the environment, and accessibility.
Unredacted TNC public Annual Reports could also be used to validate San Francisco’s
Prop D Traffic Congestion Mitigation Tax receipts, which have been irregular.

The following findings summarize the Transportation Authority’s analysis of the 2020
TNC Annual Reports, which cover the six months before the COVID pandemic and the
first six months of the  COVID pandemic. Transportation patterns changed during the pandemic
and continue to evolve. When the 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports are disclosed
consistent with the CPUC’s data confidentiality rulings, the Transportation Authority will
prepare summaries for these reporting years as well.

## Key Findings
### REPORTING COMPLIANCE & INTEGRITY
#### The public Annual Reports are incomplete by the standards set by the CPUC.
In the
2020 public Annual Reports, Lyft reported 36% of the required data as measured by the
percent of required public fields and records that are present and unredacted. Uber
reported 99.99% of the required data.

#### Uber’s and Lyft’s data is internally inconsistent.
For example, Lyft’s Annual Reports
include two different totals for the number of completed trips in the state, differing
by 49.7 million trips, or 81%. Uber’s Annual Reports also include two different totals
for the number of completed trips, differing by 9.3 million trips, or 6%. As a result, it
is not possible to identify basic facts such as the number of completed TNC trips that
occurred in California in the 2020 reporting year.

#### Many reporting requirements are not clearly defined, preventing effective regulatory oversight.
For some types of data — such as collisions, DUI complaints, law enforcement
citations, and accessibility data, the CPUC provides examples but not requirements
about how to report the data. As a result, the companies report this data differently,
preventing effective regulatory oversight.

#### Due to more extensive redactions in the 2021 Annual Reports, a less extensive evaluation of consistency is possible.
However, where consistency can be evaluated,
inconsistencies are reduced in some instances. For example, Uber’s number of
completed trips in the Requests Accepted and Aggregated Requests Accepted in their
2021 Annual Reports are perfectly consistent, and Lyft’s number of completed trips in
these reports are nearly perfect, differing by 0.004%.

### GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
#### TNC trips are highly concentrated in a few urban areas.
TNCs and ride-hail trips are an
urban, not a statewide, transportation issue, as shown in Figure 1.

#### Nearly two-thirds of TNC trips are in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego counties.
Within these counties, trips are most highly concentrated in just a few areas: San Francisco’s
downtown core, Los Angeles’ Westside, and at the San Diego airport, respectively.

#### San Francisco has 500 times more TNC trips per square mile than the rest of California.

### PUBLIC SAFETY
#### Lyft reports 3 times more total public safety incidents per trip than Uber, and 30 times more assaults and harassments per trip.
Figure 2 shows the incident rate per hundred
thousand trips and suggests that the companies may be reporting public safety
incidents differently, pointing to the need for increased review by regulators.

### LABOR
#### Uber and Lyft drivers may violate legal drive-time limits.
California law limits drivers
providing passenger transportation to “10 hours in any 24-hour period unless 8
consecutive hours off duty have elapsed.” The Annual Reports include 1.3 million days
during which drivers drove more than 10 hours. While this report alone cannot confirm
that a drive-time violation has occurred, the reports do not account for additional
factors like drivers who may be in violation due to driving for both services, or whose
shifts straddle 2 or more calendar days. No public enforcement actions have been
taken regarding possible violations of legal drive-time limits.

### ENVIRONMENT
#### Lyft’s redacted reports prevent environmental oversight.
Lyft’s annual report
withholds key data items necessary to estimate emissions: vehicle miles traveled (VMT),
geographic trip origin and destination data, and vehicle make, model, and year.

#### Uber produced 494,000 metrics tons of CO2 in reporting year 2020, based on a Transportation Authority estimate. Almost 30% of those emissions occurred with no passengers in the vehicle.
This is comparable to the CO2 emitted by the 2020 Caldwell
Fire in northern California, which burned 81,000 acres.

### ACCESSIBILITY
#### Less than half of all Wheelchair Access Vehicle (WAV) trip requests are served.
Under
the TNC Access for All Act (Senate Bill No. 1376), the CPUC established a program
where TNCs collect a fee from riders for every TNC each trip, which is then used to
subsidize on-demand transportation for persons with disabilities, including wheelchair
users who need a WAV. But even with this additional financial support, less than half of
WAV trip requests are fulfilled.

#### Uber provides nearly all TNC WAV trips in California.
Uber provided 16 times as many
WAV trips as Lyft.

| Uber | Lyft | Total
----- | ----: | ----: | ----:
WAV Requests | 217,935 | 11,605 | 229,540
Completed WAV Trips | 101,594 | 6,158 | 107,752
Completion Rate | 47% | 53% | 47%

# Conclusions
The 2020 public TNC Annual Reports reveal numerous issues related to basic
compliance with data reporting requirements, and the integrity of the data itself. At the
most basic level, Lyft’s 2020 Public Annual Reports are incomplete according to the
rules adopted by the CPUC: 8 of their 19 public reports are missing required data fields,
and 64% of all Lyft’s required public data items are missing. By contrast, Uber’s 2020
Public Annual Reports contain all but one of the required public fields. This suggests
that reporting rules are applied or enforced inconsistently.

The data contained within the 2020 TNC Public Annual Reports is often self-
contradictory and internally inconsistent. For example, Uber’s total number of trips
differs by more than 9 million from one report to the next, while Lyft’s differs by nearly
50 million trips. In some cases, the data submitted is erroneous or unreasonable: Lyft’s
reports indicate that it accepted 100% of trip requests received across vast swaths of
California. These issues are exacerbated by, if not directly caused by, data reporting
requirements that are, at times, unclear; lack of quality assurance or enforcement of
quality standards; and application of confidentiality standards that are not consistent
with the CPUC’s orders.

The lack of accurate, timely and transparent data has left localities without necessary
information to support a basic understanding of TNC operations in their jurisdictions
or their potential impacts. Timely and accurate data is fundamental to developing
sensible public policy and to identify where it is appropriate to seek improved
oversight. The pervasive data quality issues suggest the need for quality control,
greater adherence to CPUC direction regarding disclosure of data, and enforcement
of reporting requirements.

TNCs operate almost exclusively in dense urban areas and during the busiest times
of day, where they have been shown to exacerbate congestion and reduce transit
ridership. As the reports show, there may be public safety risks, environmental
harm, and issues of equitable access to TNC services. California cities, which have
no regulatory authority over TNCs, rely on the CPUC to manage impacts, enforce
regulations, and provide relevant, timely, thorough, and quality data to support the
effective development of informed public policy. Cities face similar regulatory reliance
on CPUC regarding AV passenger services. CPUC’s public AV reports are following a
similar pattern to the public TNC reports of redacted data. Timely, thorough, quality
data reporting is essential to effective research and policy-making for both TNC and AV
ride-hail passenger services, and effective regulation is critical as these new services
become more widely available.
