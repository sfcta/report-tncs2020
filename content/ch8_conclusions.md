The 2020 public TNC Annual Reports reveal numerous issues related to
basic compliance with data reporting requirements, and the integrity of
the data itself. At the most basic level, Lyft’s 2020 Public Annual Reports
are incomplete according to the rules adopted by the CPUC: 8 of their
19 public reports are missing required data fields, and 64% of all Lyft’s
required public data items are missing. By contrast, Uber’s 2020 Public
Annual Reports contain all but one of the required public fields. This
suggests that reporting rules are applied or enforced inconsistently.

The data contained within the 2020 TNC Public Annual Reports is often
self-contradictory and internally inconsistent. For example, Uber’s total
number of trips differs by more than 9 million from one report to the
next, while Lyft’s differs by nearly 50 million trips. In some cases, the data
submitted is erroneous or unreasonable: Lyft’s reports indicate that it
accepted 100% of trip requests received across vast swaths of California.

While there is improvement in the consistency of some 2021 reports, the
2021 reports are more highly redacted, and their consistencies cannot be
fully evaluated. These issues are exacerbated by, if not directly caused
by, data reporting requirements that are, at times, unclear; lack of quality
assurance or enforcement of quality standards; and application of
confidentiality standards that are not consistent with the CPUC’s orders.
The lack of accurate, timely and transparent data has left localities without sufficient
information to support a basic understanding of TNC operations in their jurisdictions
or their potential impacts. Timely and accurate data is fundamental to developing
sensible public policy and to identify where it is appropriate to seek improved
oversight. The pervasive data quality issues suggests the need for quality control,
greater adherence to Commission direction regarding disclosure of data, and
enforcement of reporting requirements.

TNCs operate almost exclusively in dense urban areas and during the busiest times
of day, where they have been shown to exacerbate congestion and reduce transit
ridership. As the reports show, there may be public safety risks, environmental
harm, and issues of equitable access to TNC services. California cities, which have
limited regulatory authority over TNCs, rely on the CPUC to manage impacts, enforce
regulations, and provide relevant, timely, thorough, and quality data to support the
effective development of informed public policy. Cities face similar regulatory reliance
on CPUC regarding AV passenger services. CPUC’s public AV reports are following a
similar pattern to the public TNC reports of redacted data. Timely, thorough, quality
data reporting is essential to effective research and policy-making for both TNC and AV
ride-hail passenger services, and effective regulation is critical as these new services
become more widely available.
