The TNC Access for All Act (Senate Bill No. 1376) directs the CPUC to
“establish a program relating to accessibility for persons with disabilities,
including wheelchair users who need a wheelchair-accessible vehicle
(WAV)”. Under the program, TNCs collect a fee on each trip which
is remitted to an Access Fund to be used to pay for “on-demand
transportation [...] to meet the needs of persons with disabilities,
including wheelchair users who need a WAV”. TNCs may request an offset,
or be exempted from remitting the fee, if they demonstrate that they
meet standards established by the CPUC.

The CPUC is authorized by the TNC Access for All Act to collect data
to manage the program. Accessibility data is regularly reported by
TNCs to the CPUC in two ways: in the form of “Advice Letters” filed by
a company when they seek an offset or exemption for a specific county
and quarter, and in the Annual Reports. Additional accessibility data is
also filed on an ad-hoc basis at the direction of the CPUC. The Annual
Reports include the number of requests for WAVs, the statewide number
of fulfilled requests, and the percent of fulfilled requests by month in the
Accessibility Report. This section compares 2020 Public Annual Reports
data from September 2019 to August 2020 with Advice Letter data that
was reported for the same period.

## How many requests for WAVs were received?  How many were accepted?
Table 31 shows the number of TNC WAV requests and completed WAV trips by each
company. Uber provided nearly all TNC WAV service in the state, receiving 95% of the
nearly 230,000 WAV requests and providing 94% of the nearly 108,000 completed WAV
trips. Uber completed 47% of the trip requests it received and Lyft completed 53%. As
noted in Chapter 3, there were between 218 million and 277 million total TNC trips, so
the 108,000 completed WAV trips account for less than 0.05% of all trips.

<figcaption>Table 31. WAV Requests and Completed Trips from September 2019 to August 2020</figcaption>

Metric | Uber | Lyft | Total
 ---- | ----: | ----: | ----:
WAV Requests | 217,935 | 11,605 | 229,540
Completed WAV Trips | 101,594 | 6,158 | 107,752
Completion Rate | 47% | 53% | 47%

## How much WAV service is being provided?
Table 32 shows the amount of WAV service measured by average monthly hours of WAV
service and number of WAV vehicles, compared to the WAV trips provided. The service
reported by each company is dramatically different from each other and suggests
that the companies are not reporting data consistently. For example, Uber reports
nearly 20,000 times the hours of WAV service than Lyft. The data also suggests highly
improbable service. Lyft’s data suggests that each vehicle provides approximately
19 seconds of service each month, compared to Uber’s much more logical 73 hours
per vehicle. On the other hand, Uber’s data suggests they are providing 924 hours
(nearly 38 days) of WAV vehicle hours for each trip they provide. Both companies
report deploying far more WAVs than the actual number of WAV trips completed. Uber
reports an average of 108,000 WAVs each month, about 13 vehicles for every WAV
trip. Lyft reports an average of 79,000 WAVs each month, about 155 vehicles for every
WAV trip. The lack of adequately defined or enforced data reporting requirements
prevents a clear understanding of WAV service and undermines confidence that it is
being regulated properly.

<figcaption>Table 32. Average Monthly WAV Service from September 2019 to August 2020</figcaption>

Metric | Uber | Lyft
 ----- | ----: | ----:
Hours of WAV Service | 7,818,750 | 419
Number of WAV Vehicles | 107,542 | 79,471
WAV Trips | 8,466 | 513
**Hours of WAV Service per Vehicle** | **72.7** | **0.005**
**Hours of WAV Service per Trip** | **923.5** | **0.8**
**WAV Vehicle per Trip** | **12.7** | **154.9**

## Is the Annual Report WAV data consistent with data reported under the Access for All Act?
Both the Annual Reports and Advice Letters filed under the Access for All program
contain data on the number of WAV requests. The Annual Reports include the total
statewide WAV requests received by month, while the Advice Letters only contain data
for selected counties and quarters in which a TNC is seeking an offset or exemption.
While the data contained in the Annual Reports and the Advice letters will not match
due to their different reporting parameters, they should be consistent and non-
contradictory with each other.

Table 33 shows the amounts requested in offsets for the costs incurred in providing WAV
service from October 2019 to June 2020, the period that the Advice Letters align with
the TNC Annual Reports. Lyft was granted $3 million in offsets, an average of $772 for
each completed WAV trip. Uber was granted $6.2 million in offsets, an average of $369
per trip. Lyft was awarded about twice the amount of offsets per completed WAV trip
than was Uber.

from October 2019 to June 2020 in the Access for All Advice Letters</figcaption>

Company | Original Requested | Final Requested | Total Approved | Completed Trips | Offsets / Trip
---- | ----: | ----: | ----: | -----: | -----:
Uber | $6,706,249.37 | $6,150,320.55 | $6,150,320.55  |  16,689  |  $368.53 
Lyft | $3,272,905.77 | $2,261,560.70 | $2,261,560.71  |  2,930  |  $771.86 

Tables 34 through 37 compare WAV data in the Annual Reports and Advice Letters.
Because the Advice Letters are not filed for every county and quarter, the Advice Letter
totals should always be less than the Accessibility Report totals. These tables show that
Uber’s Annual Reports are consistent with and do not contradict their Advice Letters,
but that Lyft’s Annual Reports are inconsistent with the Advice Letters.

Table 34 compares Uber’s WAV requests in the Annual Report and Advice Letters.
Uber’s Advice Letters contained 44% – 45% of the total WAV requests reported in the
Annual Report.

2019 Q4 | 82,089 | 35,902 | 44%
2020 Q1 | 65,053 | 28,952 | 45%
2020 Q2 | 23,047 | 10,386 | 45%

Table 35 compares Lyft’s WAV requests in the Annual Report and Advice Letters. The
WAV requests in Lyft’s Advice Letters, submitted only for San Francisco and Los Angeles
counties, exceeded the statewide totals of Lyft’s Annual Report for 2 of 3 quarters,
which should not be possible. Lyft’s Annual Reports and Advice Letters reporting
of WAV requests are inconsistent. This suggests the possibility that the Advice Letter
data used as the basis for awarding Lyft $3 million in offsets may not comply with the
requirements of the Access for All Program.[^1]

[^1]: “We find that Lyft’s Advice Letter submittals that included pre-scheduled WAV trip data failed to comply with the
requirements of the Access for All Program. Lyft unilaterally devised its own interpretation and calculation of ‘response time’
to apply to pre-scheduled WAV trips. More significantly, by including negative response times in its Advice Letter submittals,
Lyft likely lowered its total aggregate response time amounts for all WAV trips in a given quarter and geographic area. This
calls into question Lyft’s eligibility for offsets or exemptions after removal of the pre-scheduled WAV trips and the negative
response time values.” Ruling on Data Submission for Pre-Scheduled Trips, p. 16 – 17

## How many accessibility complaints were received?
The CPUC has not standardized reporting requirements for accessibility complaints. In
the absence of clear and consistent requirements, **each company decides for themselves**
how they report accessibility complaints.

Table 38 compares the taxonomies Uber and Lyft use to report accessibility complaints
and resolutions. Uber uses 4 codes to describe accessibility complaints, each describing
a type of service denial. Lyft uses 6 codes to describe accessibility complaints. One of
these codes is a combination of an alleged violation and a driver consequence, two are a
combination of an alleged violation with a determination of the validity of the allegation,
two are simple categories of service denial allegations, and the final code is, ambiguously,
“wheelchair_accessibility_policy”. Uber uses 5 codes to describe the resolution, each of
which describes a determination of the validity of the alleged violation, but does not
describe corrective actions taken against the driver. Lyft uses 3 codes to describe the
resolution, each of which is describes a corrective action taken against the driver.

<figcaption>Table 38. Comparison of Accessibility Complaint and Resolution Taxonomies
used by Uber and Lyft in the 2020 Public TNC Annual Reports</figcaption>

Type | Uber | Lyft
---- | ---- | ----
Complaint | <ul><li>Assistive Device Denial</li><li>Emotional Support/Therapy Animal Denial</li><li>Protected Trait Denial</li><li>Service Animal Denial</li></ul> | <ul><li>alleged_service_animal__driver_offboarded</li><li>alleged_service_animal_confirmed</li><li>alleged_service_animal_false_positive</li><li>refused_service_animal</li><li>wheel_chair_refusal</li><li>wheelchair_accessibility_policy</li></ul>
Resolution | <ul><li>Unresponsive driver, waitlisted pending determination</li><li>Determined plausible service denial</li><li>Determined knowing service denial</li><li>Determined neither knowing, nor plausible service denial</li><li>Determined one plausible service denial, and one knowing or plausible service denial</li></ul> | <ul><li>Driver was permanently deactivated</li><li>Driver was temporarily suspended</li><li>provided with warning and/or education</li></ul>

While Uber and Lyft report complaints using different taxonomies, each identifies
complaints that involve users of wheelchairs or other assistive devices and complaints
that involve service animals. Table 39 shows the total complaints in these categories by
company. Uber and Lyft collectively received 1,957 accessibility complaints, of which
1,743 (89%) were reported by Uber and 213 (11%) were reported by Lyft. Service denials
to users of wheelchairs or other assistive devices totaled 191 complaints, service denials
to people with service animals totaled 1,161, and other service denials totaled 604.

<figcaption>Table 39. Accessibility Complaints by Category and Company from
September 2019 to August 2020</figcaption>

Complaint Type | Uber | Lyft | Total
---- | ----: | ----: | ----:
Wheelchair or assistive device | 183 | 8 | 191
Service animal | 956 | 205 | 1,161
Other | 604 |   | 604
**Total** | **1,743** | **213** | **1,956**

The CPUC’s lack of standardized reporting requirements for the various types of
accessibility complaints prevents a clear understanding of accessibility issues and
hinders analysis and oversight.
