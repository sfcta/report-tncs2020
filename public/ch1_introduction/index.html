		<div class="inner">
      <p>Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft began providing on-demand, app-based transportation services in California in 2009.   Since 2014, TNCs operating in California have been required to submit annual reports to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).  These annual reports contain information about a wide range of topics, including but not limited to trip requests and completions, accidents and incidents, assaults and harassment, and miles and hours driven.  In February 2022, the SFCTA obtained the 2020 TNC Annual Report for Uber and Lyft.  The report documents findings from these annual reports, and is organized around a series of key questions grouped by topic area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reporting Compliance and Integrity</li>
<li>General Characteristics</li>
<li>Public Safety</li>
<li>Labor</li>
<li>Environment</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Each section identifies why the topic is a matter of public interest, the CPUC’s role in providing oversight, and what the 2020 Annual Reports tell us about TNCs in that area.  Note that Lyft’s 2020 Annual Report is substantially incomplete, which will be discussed in detail in Section 2.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-tncs">What are TNCs?</h2>
<p>Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) are companies that provide on-demand passenger service through a web-enabled platform.  Uber and Lyft are the most well-known TNCs and collectively provide almost all TNC service in California.  These services are taxi-like in that they provide point-to-point transportation, which is presently primarily provided in private vehicles.  TNCs have been shown to increase congestion by shifting trips from walking, biking, and transit, by adding “deadheading” mileage in between passenger trips, and by blocking travel lanes for pickups and drop-offs.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>   They have also been shown to decrease transit ridership.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="who-regulates-tncs-in-california">Who regulates TNCs in California?</h2>
<p>In California, TNCs are regulated by the CPUC, pursuant to the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PUC&amp;division=2.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=8.&amp;article=1.">Passenger Charter-party Carriers’ Act</a>.  TNCs operate with less regulatory constraint, oversight, and enforcement relative to taxis and other for-hire vehicles, which are regulated at the local level and are often subject to limits on fleet size and pricing, safety requirements, and are required to serve all types of passengers.  TNCs are required to comply with insurance requirements, regulations on the transportation of minors, and to conduct criminal background checks on drivers.  TNCs are required to have a driver training program, an accessibility plan, a zero-tolerance policy, a plan for avoiding divide between able and disabled communities.  TNCs are required to submit annual reports to the CPUC, and the CPUC may require additional reports or plans to be filed at its discretion.  Reporting requirements are discussed in detail in the following section.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-2020-tnc-reporting-requirements">What are the 2020 TNC reporting requirements</h2>
<p>Table 1 lists the reports required 2020 TNC Annual Reports and identifies whether they are confidential, public, or public with some confidential fields.  There are 20 individual reports, of which 19 have been designated public (including two which include &quot;Confidential&quot; in their name for legacy reasons but are, in fact, public).  The reported Driver Names &amp; IDs is the sole report designated entirely confidential as it contains personal information of drivers.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-the-cpuc-arrive-at-these-reporting-requirements">How did the CPUC arrive at these reporting requirements?</h2>
<p>CPUC develops TNC regulations through a quasi-legislative public rulemaking proceeding.  The CPUC’s Rulemaking R12-12-011 is the primary TNC rulemaking proceeding and is charged with developing regulations in the areas of safety, ridesharing between multiple passengers, transportation access (including access to public highways and to transportation services using public highways), and insurance.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  Major decisions related to data reporting, confidential treatment, and public sharing are summarized in  <a href="../xa_cpuc_decisions/">Appendix A</a>.  Annual reporting requirements were first established by Decision 13-09-045 in 2013, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed trip data</li>
<li>Public safety incidents</li>
<li>Driver mileage</li>
<li>Driver hours</li>
</ul>
<p>D. 13-09-045 also required TNCs to submit plans to ensure accessible TNC service to disabled communities.  Decision 16-04-041, issued in 2016, expanded the annual data reporting to include reports on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vehicles that were drivern over 50,000 miles in a year.</li>
<li>Drivers that were suspended related to public safety issues</li>
<li>Incidents arising from fare-splitting operations</li>
<li>How fare-splitting operations have affected the environment</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision also imposed several one-time requirements that TNCs must submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Waybills to document the calculation of fares for fare-splitting services</li>
<li>A plan for studying the impacts of fare-splitting services on traffic safety</li>
<li>A plan for studying the impacts of fare-splitting service on the environment</li>
<li>A plan for studying the impacts of TNC vehicles on traffic congestion and vehicle-miles traveled (VMT)</li>
</ul>
<!--

- established annual data reporting requirements, including:
  - For each completed trip:
    - zip codes of origin, pickup, and drop-off
    - date and time of origin, pickup, and drop-off 
    - amount paid
  - For unfulfilled trip requests:
    - zip-code of trip request
    - date and time of trip request
    - reason why the request was not fulfilled
  - Citations by law enforcement 
  - DUI complaints 
  - Assault and harassment complaints
  - Average daily driver hours  
  - Average daily driver miles
- required TNCs to submit plans to ensure accessible TNC service to disabled communities.  

D. 16-04-041
- added new annual reporting requirements:
  - report vehicles that have driven over 50,000 miles in a year
  - driver suspensions related to public safety issues, including driving under the influence (DUI), assaulting a passenger or member of the public; threatening or harassing a member of the public; or soliciting business separate from the TNC app; 
  - incidents arising from fare-splitting operations; 
  - how fare-splitting operations have impacted the environment.  
- imposed one-time requirements that TNCs must:
  - submit waybills to document the calculation of fares for fare-splitting services;
  - submit a plan for studying the impacts of fare-splitting services on traffic safety; 
  - a plan for studying the impacts of fare-splitting service on the environment; 
  - a plan for studying the impacts of TNC vehicles on traffic congestion and vehicle-miles traveled (VMT); 
  -->
<p>The annual reports required by D. 13-09-045 have never been produced publicly, with the exception of the incomplete 2020 filings documented in this report.  The record indicates only Uber submitted documentation of their fare-splitting calculations pursuant to D. 16-04-041.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  The annual report templates have never been updated to include reporting on how fare-splitting operations have affected the environment.  Finally, there appears to have been no enforcement of the  requirements to submit plans to study the safety impacts of fare-splitting TNC services, the environmental impacts of fare-splitting TNC service, or the traffic congestion and VMT impacts of TNC service.</p>
<p>While the rulemaking track identifies the categories of data required of TNC Annual Reports, CPUC Consumer Protection and Enforcement Division (CPED) staff develop report templates and reporting guidance.  CPED staff have revised report templates and guidance over time often without general public notice or explanation.  It is unclear why the data reporting appears to be sometimes modified by Commission action, and other times modified by agency staff.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-the-cpuc-determine-what-is-confidential-vs-public-data">How did the CPUC determine what is confidential vs public data?</h2>
<p>The CPUC rulemaking R12-12-011 also establishes what data is confidential and what data is public.  <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M077/K192/77192335.PDF">Decision 13-09-045</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> established a presumption of confidentiality, which was reversed by <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M329/K477/329477640.PDF">Decision 20-03-014</a>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  Reports filed before 2020 were presumed confidential, while reports filed in 2020 and after are presumed public.  Under D. 20-03-014, a TNC must request confidential treatment of certain data items in their annual reports, and substantiate their requests with “granular specificity”.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Both Uber and Lyft submitted motions with sweeping requests for confidential treatment of their 2020 Annual Reports.  The CPUC’s Administrative Law Judge has ruled strongly in favor of public disclosure of the reports, while respecting the need prevent the disclosure of potentially personally identifiable information.  The <em>Assigned Administrative Law Judge's Ruling on Uber Technologies, Inc.'s and Lyft's Motion for Confidential Treatment of Certain Information in Their 2020 Annual Reports</em> (&quot;2020 Confidentiality Ruling&quot;) granted confidential treatment to data items relating to driver information, precise latitude and longitude, certain information about assaults and harassments, and information that is sealed under a court order or protected through a confidentiality agreement, but rejected confidential treatment of the majority of data items, finding no merit in the claims of disclosure of personal information or of trade secrets.  The CPUC Commissioners also found “significant difficulties and delays in obtaining TNCs’ annual report data based upon broad-brush-style or rushed confidentiality claims,” and that “TNCs’ failures to timely comply with the annual reporting requirements have delayed the expeditious review of TNC data and the production of nonconfidential data to the public.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>As of the writing of this report, the CPUC has not released any TNC Annual Reports publicly, other than through Public Record Act (PRA) requests.  The CPUC has only released a single set of Uber Annual Reports (for the year 2020), and has never released a complete public version of any Lyft’s Annual Reports.  The CPUC has also released incomplete versions of Uber’s and Lyft’s 2021 Annual Reports.</p>
