      <p>The TNC Access for All Act (Senate Bill No. 1376) directs the CPUC to “establish a program relating to accessibility for persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users who need a wheelchair-accessible vehicle (WAV)”.  Under the program, TNCs collect a fee on each trip which is remitted to an Access Fund to be used to pay for “on-demand transportation […] to meet the needs of persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users who need a WAV”.  TNCs may request an offset, or be exempted from remitting the fee, if they demonstrate that they meet standards established by the CPUC.  The CPUC is authorized by the TNC Access for All Act to collect data to manage the program.  Accessibility data is regularly reported by TNCs to the CPUC in two ways: in the form of “Advice Letters” filed by a company when they seek an offset or exemption for a specific county and quarter, and in the Annual Reports.  Additional accessibility data is also filed on an ad-hoc basis at the direction of the CPUC.  The Annual Reports include the number of requests for wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs), the statewide number of fulfilled requests, and the percent of fulfilled requests by month in the Accessibility Report.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-requests-for-wavs-were-received--how-many-were-accepted">How many requests for WAVs were received?  How many were accepted?</h2>
<p>Table 30 shows the number of WAV requests and completed WAV trips by each company.  Uber provided nearly all WAV service in the state, receiving 95% of the nearly 230,000 WAV requests and providing 94% of the nearly 108,000 completed WAV trips.  Uber completed 47% of the trip requests it received and Lyft completed 53%.  As noted in Chapter 3, there were between 218 million and 277 million total TNC trips, so the 108,000 completed WAV trips account for less than a 0.05% of all trips.</p>

<p>Table 31 shows the amount of WAV service measured by average monthly hours of WAV service and number of WAV vehicles, compared to the WAV trips provided.  The service reported by each company is dramatically different from each other and suggests that the companies are not reporting data consistently.  For example, Uber reports nearly 20,000 times the hours of WAV service than Lyft.  The data also suggests highly improbable service.  Lyft’s data suggests that each vehicle provides approximately 19 seconds, compared to Uber’s much more logical 73 hours per vehicle.  On the other hand, Uber’s data suggests they are providing 924 hours (nearly 38 days) of WAV vehicle hours for each trip they provide.  Both companies report providing far more WAV vehicles than trips.  Uber reports an average of 108,000 WAVs each month, about 13 vehicles for every WAV trip.  Lyft reports an average of 79,000 WAVs each month, about 155 vehicles for every WAV trip.  The failure of the CPUC to adequately define or enforce data reporting requirements precludes the proper regulation and enforcement of WAV service.</p>

<h2 id="is-the-annual-report-wav-data-consistent-with-data-reported-under-the-access-for-all-act">Is the Annual Report WAV data consistent with data reported under the Access for All Act?</h2>
<p>Both the Annual Reports and Advice Letters filed under the Access for All program contain data on the number of WAV requests.  The Annual Reports include the total statewide WAV requests received by month, while the Advice Letters only contain data for selected counties and quarters in which a TNC is seeking an offset or exemption.  While the data contained in the Annual Reports and the Advice letters will not match due to their different reporting parameters, they should be consistent with and should not contradict each other.<br>
Table 32 shows the amounts requested in offsets from September 2019 to August 2020, the same period in the Annual Reports.  Lyft was granted $3 million in offsets, an average of $488 for each completed WAV trip.  Uber was granted $6.2 million in offsets, an average of $61 per trip.  Lyft was awarded nearly 8 times the amount of offsets per completed WAV trip than was Uber.</p>

<p>Tables 33 through 34 compare WAV data in the Annual Reports and Advice Letters.  Because the Advice Letters contain only a subset of counties, the Advice Letter totals should always be less than the Accessibility Report totals.

<p>Table 34 compares Lyft’s WAV requests in the Annual Report and Advice Letters.  The WAV requests in Lyft’s Advice Letters, submitted only for San Francisco and Los Angeles counties, exceeded the statewide totals of Lyft’s Annual Report for 2 of 3 quarters, which should not be possible.  Lyft’s Annual Reports and Advice Letters reporting of WAV requests are inconsistent.  This suggests the possibility that the Advice Letter data used as the basis for awarding Lyft $3 million in offsets may be erroneous.</p>

<p>The CPUC has not standardized reporting requirements for accessibility complaints.  In the absence of clear and consistent requirements, each company decides themselves how they report accessibility complaints.</p>
<p>Table 37 compares the taxonomies Uber and Lyft use to report accessibility complaints and resolutions.  Uber uses 4 codes to describe accessibility complaints, and each describing a type of service denial.  Lyft uses 6 codes to describe accessibility complaints.  One of these codes is a combination of an alleged violation and a driver consequence, two are a combination of an alleged violation with a determination of the validity of the allegation, two are simple categories of service denial allegations, and the final code is, ambiguously, “wheelchair_accessibility_policy”.  Uber uses 5 codes to describe the resolution, each of which describes a determination of the validity of the alleged violation, but does not describe corrective actions taken against the driver.  Lyft uses 3 codes to describe the resolution, each of which is describes a corrective action taken against the driver.</p>

<p>While Uber and Lyft report complaints using different taxonomies, each identifies complaints that involve users of wheelchairs or other assistive devices and complaints that involve service animals. Table 38 shows the total complaints in these categories by company.  Uber and Lyft collectively received 1,957 accessibility complaints, of which 1,743 (89%) were reported by Uber and 213 (11%) were reported by Lyft.   Service denials to users of wheelchairs or other assistive devices totaled 191 complaints, service denials to people with service animals totaled 1,161, and other service denials totaled 604.</p>
